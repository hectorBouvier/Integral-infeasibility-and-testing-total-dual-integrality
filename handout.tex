% \subsubsection*{Complementary Slackness Theorem}

% Let $x^*$ and $y^*$ be feasible solutions in the primal and dual problem respectively.
% That is, $Ax^* \leq b$ and $y^* A = w; y^* \geq 0$. \\
% Then $w x^* = y^* b$ iff. $(y^*)_i > 0  \Rightarrow A_i x^* = b_i$

% \subsubsection*{Farkas' Lemma}

% For $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, b \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ then exactly one of the following is true:
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item There exists $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $Ax \leq b$.
%     \item There exists $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $yA=0, yb<0$ and $y \geq 0$. 
% \end{enumerate}

% Furthermore, in relation to Farkas Lemma it holds that exactly one of the following is true:

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item There exists $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $Ax=b$. 
%     \item There exists $y \in \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $yA=0$ and $by \neq 0$.
% \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Definitions}

Add total dual integrallity definition.!



For a system $Ax \leq b$ of $m$ linear inequalities and a set $T\subset \{1, \dots, m \}$ let $A_T x = b_T$ and $A_{\bar{T}} x \leq b_{\bar{T}}$, where $\bar{T} := \{1, \dots, m \} \setminus T$, denote the system obtained by settig each inequality in T to equaltiy.

\subsection*{Integrally proven infisibility}

We say that the \textbf{infisibility} of (2) can be \textbf{proven integrally} if (4) does in fact have an integral solution. 


\subsection*{Theorem 1}

Let $A\in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$ and $b$ a rational vector such that the linear system $Ax \leq b$ has at least one solution. Then $Ax \leq b$ is totally dual integral \textbf{if and only if}

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item the rows of $A$ form a Hilbert basis, and

        \item for each subset $T$ of inequalities from $Ax\leq b$, if * is infeasible, then this can be proven interally.

    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Theorem 2}

Let $A\in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$ and $b$ a rational vector such that the linear system $Ax \leq b$ has at least one solution. Then $Ax \leq b$ is totally dual integral \textbf{if and only if}

    \begin{enumerate}

        \item the rows of $A$ form a Hilbert basis, and

        \item for each subset $T$ of at most $n$ inequalities from $Ax\leq b$, the linear programming problem \\
        $min\{yb: yA=1\cdot A_T, y\geq 0 \}$ has an integral solution.

    \end{enumerate}
